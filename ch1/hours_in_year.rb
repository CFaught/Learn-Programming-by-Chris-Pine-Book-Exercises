# This is the first assignment in the Learn Programming book by Chris Pine.
# The basic idea is to calulate the number of hours in a year.
# This is my attempt at the assignment.

days_in_year = 365
days_in_leap_year = 366

total_hours = days_in_year * 24

puts "hours in a year: #{total_hours}
or in a leap year: #{days_in_leap_year * 24}"
